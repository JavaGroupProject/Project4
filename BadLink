				+ "1. While downloading any file close all the applications that "
				+ "are running on your computer, let only one set-up file run "
				+ "at a time of downloading. \n\n2. Close all the important applications "
				+ "in order to be safe if something goes wrong while downloading. "
				+ "\n\n3. Set firewalls, set antivirus to actively scan all the files "
				+ "you download. \n\n4. Scan all the files after you download whether "
				+ "from websites or links received from e-mails. \n\n5. Always use "
				+ "updated antivirus, spam filter and spyware to help detect "
				+ "and remove virus, spyware from the application you want to "
				+ "download. \n\n6. Never download any files like music, video, games "
				+ "and many more from untrusted sites and don’t go by the "
				+ "recommendations given by your friends or made by any random "
				+ "website's comments. \n\n7. Check that the URLs are same and always "
				+ "download games, music or videos from the secure websites like "
				+ "which use HTTPS websites instead of HTTP. In the web address, "
				+ "it replaces “http” to https”. The https refers to the hypertext "
				+ "transfer protocol secure. \n\n8. Download anything only from "
				+ "thrust worthy websites. Don’t click links to download anything "
				+ "you see on unauthorized sites. \n\n9. If any dirty words appear "
				+ "on the website just close the window no matter how important it "
				+ "is, because  spyware may be installed on your PC from such websites. "
				+ "\n\n 10. Check the size of the file before you download, sometimes "
				+ "it shows a very small size but after you click it increases the size "
				+ "of the file. \n\n11. Never believe anything which says click on this "
				+ "link and  your computer settings will be changed and your PC can be "
				+ "turned into XBOX and can play unlimited games on your computer. "
				+ "\n\n12. Don’t accept anything that offers you free download because "
				+ "that may contain malicious software. \n\n13. Don’t click the link "
				+ "or file and let it start download automatically, download the file "
				+ "and save where you want save and then run on the application. \n\n"
				+ "14. Set secure browser settings before you download anything. \n\n"
				+ "15. Read carefully before you click on install or run application. "
				+ "That means read terms and conditions. \n\n16. Don’t download anything "
				+ "until you know complete information of the website and know whether "
				+ "it is an original site of an original company. \n\n17. Never download "
				+ "from the links that offer free antivirus or anti spyware software, "
				+ "always download from trusted sites, if you are not sure about the site "
				+ "you are downloading, enter the site into favourite search engine to see "
				+ "anyone posted or reported that it contains unwanted technologies.";
